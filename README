Code and notes for the ruby exercises for 7 Languages in 7 Weeks.

Feel free to abuse as you see fit.

The version of ruby I have installed on my machine is 1.8.7. There are some
differences between this version and version 1.9. Where possible (and I know
about it <--- still learning :)) I will flag any differences in the notes.
