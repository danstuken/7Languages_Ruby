A ruby range is a sequence containing all values from and including a start
value up to and optionally including an end value.

The core api docs for ranges can be found here:
http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Range.html

Some examples:

(1)
irb(main):003:0> (1..4).each do |v|
irb(main):004:1* puts v
irb(main):005:1> end
1
2
3
4
=> 1..4

(2)
irb(main):006:0> Range.new(1,4).each do |v|
irb(main):007:1* puts v
irb(main):008:1> end
1
2
3
4
=> 1..4

(3)
irb(main):009:0> Range.new(1,4,false).each do |v|
irb(main):010:1* puts v
irb(main):011:1> end
1
2
3
4
=> 1..4

(4)
irb(main):012:0> Range.new(1,4,true).each do |v|
irb(main):013:1* puts v
irb(main):014:1> end
1
2
3
=> 1...4

(1)
 The range is constructed using a literal expression and we can see from the
output that both the start and end are included in the range.

(2)
 The range is constructed using the Range.new method. We see the same results
as last time

(3)
 Passing in the third boolean parameter we can see that the default for this
parameter is false, as the end value is still included in the range.

(4)
 Setting the optional third constructor parameter to true has excluded the end
value from the range.
