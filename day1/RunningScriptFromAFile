As a first attempt at this I went with standard unix practice:

Script started on Mon 13 Jun 2011 06:27:44 PM BST
[dan@home day1]$ which ruby
/usr/bin/ruby
[dan@home day1]$ echo '#!/usr/bin/ruby' > test1.rb
[dan@home day1]$ echo 'puts "hello world"' >> test1.rb
[dan@home day1]$ chmod +x ./test1.rb
[dan@home day1]$ ./test1.rb
hello world

Cool, so this works. Quick google required to see if there's an official way
of doing this. Yay! it is. Rock on.
